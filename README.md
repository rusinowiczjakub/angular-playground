# AngularPlayground

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

The purpose of project was getting started with Angular architecture, learn how TypeScript works, and to learn very basics of angular, such as Animations, Pipes. Now I'm starting to develop SPA Web Store with Angular Frontend and REST API developed with PHP and Symfony Framework. Check my progress [HERE](https://github.com/rusinowiczjakub/reTRY-store-angular)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
